### App Description

<b>Find an optimal location to meetup with friends!</b>

Finding a location to meetup with friends is difficult, especially when trying to find a place which is at a fair distance from every person. Rally helps solve this problem by choosing a place to meetup which is equidistant from each person, resulting in a fair place to get together and have fun!

Use Google Search to input the locations of your friends, and click 'Search' to find the right place to meet.
